## Professional Projects

Drupal and then Wordpress, I cut my teeth learning about frameworks and database management working for [Nonprofit National School Reform Faculty](https://nsrfharmony.org) between 2016 and 2018. Great people, and a great mission.

In the summer of 2015 had fun creating a few graphs for a friends website. I learned remote desktoping, javascript, and how to navigate a .NET framework. So much fun. For any Fantasy Football enthusiasts it is a great site and it has made some really nice upgrades since I last helped out on the site [Fantasy Football Analytics](https://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/about-the-site).

## Personal Projects - Progress in Work

I understand frameworks are a must for large scale organizations but I prefer to build everything by hand (a few javascript libraries here and there don't hurt - talking about you D3) because I am just really motivated by the process more than the results. So my Personal websites look pretty funky especially the ones I have not touched in years

[Works in Progress](http://threeps.herokuapp.com)This site should be called "Open Source Data LETS BUILD BAR CHARTS" because that is what I did. What is missing is all the Python code I wrote to scrape the data, clean the data, and push into databases.

[Hand Built Website](http://computerjunction.github.io/index.html) This website should be called "Casinos are just weird and FUN?" because I played craps and decided I wanted to play craps at home so I built an entire website centered around this casino game.

More coming soon as I have another idea
