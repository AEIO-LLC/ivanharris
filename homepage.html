  <h1>Body of work</h1>
  <h2>Professional Projects</h2>
  <div>  Drupal and then Wordpress, I cut my teeth learning about frameworks and database management working for <a href="https://nsrfharmony.org/">Nonprofit National School Reform Faculty </a> between 2016 and 2018.  Great people, and a great mission.</div>
  In the summer of 2015 had fun creating a few graphs for a friends website.  I learned remote desktoping, javascript, and how to navigate a .NET framework.  So much fun.  For any Fantasy Football enthusiasts it is a great site and it has made some really nice upgrades since I last helped out on the site
<a href="https://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/about-the-site">Fantasy Football Analytics </a>.
  <h2>Personal Projects - Progress in Work</h2>
  <div>I understand frameworks are a must for large scale organizations but I prefer to build everything by hand (a few javascript libraries here and there don't hurt - talking about you D3) because I am just really motivated by the process more than the results.  So my Personal websites look pretty funky especially the ones I have not touched in years </div>
  <div><a href="http://threeps.herokuapp.com/">Works in Progress</a>This site should be called "Open Source Data LETS BUILD BAR CHARTS" because that is what I did.  What is missing is all the Python code I wrote to scrape the data, clean the data, and push into databases.</div>
  <div><a href="http://computerjunction.github.io/index.html">Hand Built Website</a>  This website should be called "Casinos are just weird" because I played craps and decided I wanted to play craps at home so I built an entire website centered around this casino game.</div>
  <div>More coming soon as I have another idea</div>
